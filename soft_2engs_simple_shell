.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh
.I (no options included as of this writing (June 22, 2023))

.SH DESCRIPTION

Simple_shell is a basic program that works like a UNIX shell. It was designed to have only the most important features, like the first UNIX shell made by Ken Thompson. It was made, tested, and used on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

.SH OVERVIEW

Just like other command line programs, the simple_shell program gets commands from either the terminal or scripts and runs them as they are written..

.SH INVOCATION

The GNU Compiler Collectiojn, gcc, is recommended for compiling simple_shell with extra flags as shown.
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE

In interactive mode, the simple_shell works by taking user input on the terminal after pressing the enter key. Note that the prompt ('$') will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by "enter."

.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE

In non-interactive mode, users can specify shell scripts to be executed by simple_shell usually through the use of pipes '|'.
.P
.RS
.B echo 'pwd' | ./hsh
